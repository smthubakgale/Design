**Android Development**

The issue when it comes to developing applications is that we are
required to learn languages such as C\# or Java , which are good
languages to learn , but they have a lot of requirements and require a
lot of nugget packages to design interfaces . So for most Apps design is
top priority because it determines whether Client or Customers will be
attracted to your App .

It has since dawned upon me that sometimes basic is the way to go . The
basic languages for a good interface usually include HTML , CSS and
Javascript/jQuery . But these languages are for web platforms . Thus
designing the interfaces using these languages aleavates a lot of design
constraints . As such the **template in this repository** basically
shows how you can develop an application with Xamarin C\# but use web
design for the Interface .

It also shows how to navigate between pages .

NB: Note that the project is under MIT license , thus it can be used for
academic purposes , but for non-commercial use , unless proper
permission is obtained from the developer , it can be used in all school
projects .
